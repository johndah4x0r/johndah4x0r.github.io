I am an aspiring developer who values curiosity over 
specialization. Whether it's an academic Python prototype,
a backend service, or a legacy x86 operating system, I build
things because I want to understand them, and I learn whatever
I need along the way.

As of **2025-08-15**, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's
degree in *Electronics, Informatics and Technology* at the
**University of Oslo**. (term 5 / 6)
